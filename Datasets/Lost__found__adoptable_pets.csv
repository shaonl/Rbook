I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",BLUE

I am a pretty easy-going and do allow people to hold me.<p/>Rabbits are intelligent and complex animals who do well in families with humans who understand that they are prey animals, and do not enjoy being picked up or held. The best way to bond with me is to spend time with me on the floor, and shower me with plenty of greens and timothy hay! <p/><p/>I am a domestic rabbit and it is recommend that adopters keep me indoors. The nice thing about having an indoor rabbit is that I can come out of my cage for bunny playtime, in a rabbit proof area of the home.

My name is June, and I am a happy, smart, and playful little dog.  I am in foster care because I had hip surgery, but now I can run around again, so I`m ready to find my forever home.  While in foster care, I`ve learned a bunch of new things, including how to go for walks on a leash, how to make friends with cats, and how to pee and poop outside (full disclosure: I sometimes forget that last one, but I am working on it).  I love squeaky toys and tug toys!  My favorite games are fetching and keep-away.  I enjoy playing with the other dogs in my foster home, and I would love to find a home with another small dog who could be my friend.  But so long as you will play with me sometimes, I will be fine as an only dog.<p/>",BLUE

She really is my best friend forever and is a Federally Registered Emotional Support Animal. I love her dearly and she loves me . She kisses, hugs, and nussles me many times a day. She sleeps by my side every night. We just secured a home in Maple Valley where I've lived since 1954. Please help her to get home and be with her loving; dad. She was out to potty at 3am on the 3rd prior to any fireworks. This was behind Stockton's restaurant; Maple Valley Hwy and Wax Rd.. She has never left the immediate area where we have traveled so I suspect someone, thinking she was a stray, took her in to protect her from the booms expected later  the next day.

Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature I would do best in a quiet home with older children who can understand when I might need breaks from petting. <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature I would do best in a quiet home with older children who can understand when I might need breaks from petting. <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",BLUE

I was surrendered by my owner on 7/10/23 and now I'm available for adoption! <p/><p/>I've had a bit of a rough go of it lately - I broke my leg and ended up needing surgery! Now I'm a tri-paw'd dog. This means I only have three legs, I'm missing my left hind. I get along just fine without it though. In fact I was up and running the day after surgery! My missing piece is not expected to cause any limitations in my life going forward, I'm just like any other dog. <p/><p/>I have a pretty easy-going personality. At first, I like to do my own thing, but if you give me some time I do love pets and will come around for the ear scratches. I LOVE going for walks, I get so excited when I see the leash, so walking together would be a good way to build a relationship with me. <p/><p/>My other love in life is food. I like my personal space when I'm eating - I'll come find you when I'm done. Because of my need for space when I'm eating, I would do best in a home with adults only, or a home with older children who don't mind leaving me alone at breakfast and dinner.<p/><p/>I am 48lbs, making me a medium size dog. My adoption fee is $250. <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",RED

Just offer me a couple pets and I'll quickly show you how friendly I become :)<p/><p/>I may be an older guy, but I still have a lot of love and spunk left in me. I am looking for a calm and quiet home where I can live out the rest of my golden years.<p/><p/>If you have a soft spot for older cats please come down to RASKC to visit me!<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE, but I could easily be a GREEN. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",

In my previous home I quickly learned how to sit on command and I'm completely house broken! I am a jumper, so I'll need a family who is comfortable with bouncy, large dogs and who can teach me to keep four on the floor. I will require lots of room to run around to help keep me in shape and burn off my extra energy.<p/><p/>I love to play and may get along with other large dogs so a multi-dog household could potentially be a good fit. It would be a good idea to introduce me slowly to any resident dogs so we can make good impressions on each other. <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

Although your new pet is ready for adoption, there is always a possibility of additional medical conditions that have not been detected or may develop in the future.  Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)    Feline Immunodeficiency Virus<p/><p/>This cat tested positive for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).  FIV can cause immunosuppression and susceptibility to other diseases.  Symptoms are varied but may include fever, anorexia, weight loss, or stomatitis.  Not all infected cats will become ill, and those that do may be healthy for weeks to years before illness.  Cats infected with FIV will remain infected for life and can spread the virus to other cats, usually through bite wounds.  For this reason, FIV cats should be kept indoors only, and should only be housed with FIV positive cats or in situations where risk of transmission is unlikely.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p/><p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>",GREEN

I am a tad chonky and could benefit from a little weight loss.<p/><p/>I am one treat motivated gal, but don't understand the concept of doing commands for them yet.<p/><p/>I am FULL of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. Due to that fact I would do best in a home with older children.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or I may need a very slow introduction to other dogs.<p/><p/>I am a looking for a family that is dog-savvy and have experience with training. Although I am an adult I was not taught any basic manners before arriving at RASKC.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

My name is Dutch and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought into RASKC on June 16, 2023 because my owner left and never came back for me. I lived in a home with other male cats, but we didn't really get along. The people caring for me think it's partly because I was the only intact cat in the home. I was described as very sweet, loving and a food lover! I was returned  on July 1st; I'm a bit of a shy-guy, and the family that took me home was looking for an adventurous, outgoing cat. Sometimes these things just don't work out, and that's okay! <p/><p/>As I admitted, I can be a tad shy, but being at RASKC is just really new to me. Just give me a little time to warm up to you and I'll be begging for pets :)<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home, without any small kids.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",BLUE

I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with us and keep an eye out for signs that We might need a break.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that we seem to do well with other cats. When meeting cats in a new home, We would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>Because of our shy nature, we would do best in a calm, quiet home.<p/><p/>We are sweet kitten's who may need extra time and attention to warm up to new situations and new people. When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but we are learning quickly! Though timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",RED

My name is Eeyore and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on May 13, 2023.<p/><p/>I weigh 65.0 lbs and am considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I am a very treat motivated dog and will ""sit"" for them. <p/><p/>I must admit I am a very shy dude and may have stranger danger. I was orginally found out in the fields alone before arriving at RASKC so I may have a hard time trusting people at first. Once I know you I show my silly side.<p/><p/>I walk well on leash and my foster parent reported that I did not have any accidents in the home, and appear to be potty trained; I know what to do when I go outside! ;) <p/><p/>I'm quite the couch potato, and have been described as low-energy. I might not enjoy long hikes in the outdoors, but I would enjoy sitting by your side at the lake, on the couch, or really anywhere! Once I get to know you I'm very loyal and like to cuddle with my person, but I don't share well with others so a home with other cats and dogs would not be a good fit for me. <p/><p/>Due to my shy nature I would thrive best in a home WITHOUT younger children (fast movements and loud noises scare me). I would probably do best in a single person home or introduce me to new people gradually.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

My name is Panzer! I was brought to RASKC by a good samaritan on 5/22/23 after I tried to board a school bus with some children! I really liked them and the person who brought me in agreed that I seem great with kids.<p/><p/>I'm 7 years old but I'm young at heart with good amount of energy. My name, Panzer, means tank which is fitting because I'm definitely a large breed dog - I weigh 88lbs! I've got the strength to match my size and weight. While I'm generally responsive to my handler I still have some learning to do. My leash skills are moderate - I'm still learning to walk next to a person and not charge ahead all the time - but I do have a solid ""sit"" command and I'm rapidly learning my new name. My energy level is moderate to high, I will need to get out for regular walks and/or engaging time with my family playing fetch, tug or going for a hike.<p/><p/>I can be a bit too forward with other dogs and should probably be the only animal in the home due to my size and strength. However, I am great at ignoring other dogs when I'm on leash. I'd rather focus on you!<p/><p/>It's important that my new home understands German Shepherds as a breed! I will need someone who is confident in their training ability and able to help me be the best dog I can be! German Shepherds are smart and loyal dogs, however they can also be prone to anxiety and nervousness so its important that my adopter is able to maintain my current confidence level (high) while teaching me new skills. <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

Once I have time to warm up to you I will happily accept pets.<p/><p/>I am treat motivated and will ""sit"" for them.<p/><p/>My caregivers mention that I am a destructor of toys! :)<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",BLUE

My name is Pinky and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good Samaritan on April 23rd, 2023.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I will do best as the only cat in my new home. I also don't seem to like little kids; I might be very loving, but I still have boundries I need respected.<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/>Medical Waiver<p/>Your new pet received a basic physical exam, in addition to routine vaccines, deworming, and topical flea preventative, if indicated.  Although your new pet is ready for adoption, there is always a possibility of additional medical conditions that have not been detected or may develop in the future.  Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)  Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (FIV)- FIV is a viral infection that is transmitted between cats usually through fighting.  This is a lifelong infection with no cure.  FIV cats can have shorter lifespans, however many of them can live many years in good health with proper management and care.
